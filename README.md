Arduino Project - Memory Game

In this assignment, we were challenged to create our own tech tutorial of the desired choice of hardware and software. We decided to create a basic memory recall game based off an Arduino Uno. The equipment required for this project was:
-	4 LEDs (red, yellow, green and purple)
-	2 breadboards
-	Arduino Uno
-	4 buttons
-	8 resistors
-	20-40 cables
-	1 power cable
-	Power source (able with coding language)

## **How it was done**

There are two main ways that pushbuttons can work. One is by allowing or preventing a certain amount of current through a circuit. This current can then be read as “LOW” or “HIGH” for when the button is pressed or not pressed, respectively. This is different to how buttons are sometimes used to act as switches to allow current through when pressed to complete something else on the same circuit. E.g. when a button is pressed, current is allowed through the circuit to sound a buzzer. This option is more hardware based whereas the first option relies more on software to complete actions

For our system, we opted to use the buttons purely for a user input and then tackle the LEDs through software as this be more wire efficient and would be easier to code for.

This meant that each LED and each button was wired up completely independently from another. We wired the LEDs on one breadboard and the buttons on another for aesthetic purposes only.


### **Basic Wiring**

Each LED and each button needed to have a ground cable and a designated slot on the Arduino. The buttons also needed a 5v power input to determine if the current was high or low at any time. Each of the LEDS also needed to have a 1000ohm resistor in the circuit to ensure that the bulb did not blow. Because the buttons and the LEDs were wired on the same bread board and in parallel, only one ground cable was needed per bread board.



### **How the game works**

The game features 4 LEDs on one breadboard and 4 corresponding pushbuttons on a separate breadboard. The LEDs flash in a sequence randomly generated by the code. The user then has to try to replicate this sequence by pushing the buttons in a specific order. If the user gets the correct sequence, then the system indicates this by shining all 4 LEDs. Then the game repeats at a faster speed. The repetition continues until the user fails to answer correctly, when this happens, the red LED flashes 3 times and the game ends. The user is then able to look at the console to see how many times they were able to correctly guess the sequence. 


### **Harder than it looks**

Initially, the game may seem very easy to code for, but in reality, it is not. This is because the Arduino does not use standard C++ but a special version with separate libraries. In addition, the LEDs cannot be randomised straight away. Instead, the index of the pin that the LED is attached to is set to a variable. This variable is then placed in a list with the other LED variables. Items from this list are then randomly selected and that order is reassigned to the LEDs.
